            <h3>Payments and Fees</h3>
            <p>Establishment of support and administrative services is dependent upon receipt by the Company of payment of stated charges. Subsequent payments are due on the anniversary date of the month for that month's service. Customer agrees that The Company automatically charges customer’s credit card, check or Paypal account every month. For prepaid services, the term shall terminate when credit is no longer sufficient to pay for services.</p>
            <p>SupportEagles generates and sends all invoices 14 days in advance of the due date. You are responsible to pay any payments and fees by the due date.<p><br>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Monthly Service Fees: Fees for service(s) ordered by the Customer shall begin on the date of the initial order and that date shall serve as the monthly anniversary date for all future invoices including one time fees, upgrades, additional services, cancellations and service credits. Fees are due in advance of the monthly service cycle, and will be billed on the anniversary date of each month.</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Upgrade Fees: Upgrades ordered on the billing anniversary date will be billed for a full month service and will continue each month on the anniversary date. Upgrades ordered after the normal anniversary billing date will be pro-rated to the next anniversary date and billed as a one time pro-rata charge. Future charges will appear as full monthly fees added to your existing anniversary billing date.</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Additional Service Fees: Additional services ordered on the billing anniversary date will be billed for the full month service and will continue each month on the anniversary date. Additional services ordered after the normal anniversary billing date will be pro-rated to the next anniversary date and billed as a one time pro-rata charge. Future charges will appear as full monthly fees added to your existing anniversary billing date.</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> One Time Fees: One time fees, such as setup fees, administrative fees, software development projects and late fees are due and payable at the time they are incurred, and agreed upon in writing or via ticket with approval.</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Late Fees: Clients have the option to pay an invoice at any time by logging into the <a href="https://clients.supporteagles.com/">Client Portal</a> and submitting a payment. An invoice that is not paid by the due date is automatically marked overdue in the system. If an invoice is overdue by more than 3 days (the grace period), the service is automatically suspended and a $15.00 late fee is added to the account. To reactivate an account that is suspended for failure to submit a payment within the grace period, a payment for the original invoiced amount plus $15.00 must be submitted to SupportEagles.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Failure to Pay:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> SupportEagles may temporarily deny service or terminate this Agreement upon the failure of the customer to pay charges when due. Such termination or denial will not relieve subscriber of responsibility for the payment of all accrued charges. Service will be interrupted on accounts that reach 7 days past due.</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> SupportEagles will not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer because of your failure to make payment. SupportEagles makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied, for the services we provide.</li>

            <h3>Cancellations</h3>
            <p>All services require a 72 hour notice before the due date of the next invoice in order to cancel the service. All cancellations must be made through our <a href="https://clients.supporteagles.com/"><strong>Client Portal</strong></a>. All requests are manually reviewed and processed by our staff. If any of the information supplied in the form does not match your account records, we will contact you via email to confirm the correct details. Your account is not canceled until you receive an email from a member of our staff (not an automated reply) confirming that your account cancellation was completed.</p>
            <p>If you have a past-due balance on your account at the time the account is closed (either by your request or due to non-payment), the remaining balance must be paid within 30 days of when the account is closed. If we do not receive payment on the remaining balance in that time, we will begin efforts to collect any fees owed. If our internal collection efforts fail, we reserve the right to turn the account over to a third party (either a collections agency or an attorney) for further action.
